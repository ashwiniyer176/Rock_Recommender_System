# Rock_Recommender_System

A recommender system for rock/metal songs based on the [History of Rock(1950-2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/lukaszamora/history-of-rock-19502020) dataset.

Idea:
1. Clusters similar songs on the dataset into 9 categories
2. Adds the categories to dataset
3. Gets first n recommendations (not best/most similar n)
